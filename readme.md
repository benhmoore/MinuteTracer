This project consists of a ray-tracing renderer following the implementation outlined in Gabriel Gambetta's *Computer Graphics From Scratch*, available for purchase [here](https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch).

A demo can be found in the file, `demo.py`.

This repository consists of the following project components:

1. A **renderer package** that handles the meat of the ray-tracing tasks. This package is contained with the `/renderer` subdirectory.

2. A **modeler package** that provided classes and tools to describe the 3D scene to be rendered. This package is contained within the `/modeler` subdirectory.

## Development Map
The development of this minute system of packages will, in general, follow the progression of chapters in *Computer Graphics From Scratch*. This timeline is fundamentally constructed around the development of the `renderer` package.

* [--] **Chapter 2: Basic Raytracing**

    * [&#10003;] Begin fundamental documentation and package development, including implementation of the rendering features discussed in Chapter 2.
    * [&#10003;] Remove windowing experiments to maintain focus on raytracer
    * [--] Refactor pass
